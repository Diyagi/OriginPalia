# Repository Standards

First of all, thank you for taking your time to work on this project!

In order to keep this repository organized, we ask of you to follow some steps to ensure that we follow some standards.

## Clang-Format

If you are using Visual Studio Clang-Format should already be enabled, just make sure to apply the formatting on each modified file before commiting (Ctrl+K Ctrl+D).
You can also use an extension from the marketplace to format the code, like this one: [Format All Files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=munyabe.FormatAllFiles)

## Pre-Commit Hooks

The repository also ship with pre-commit hooks, this will apply the formatting automatically before every commit.
To use it you can follow [this quick start tutorial](https://pre-commit.com/)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are currently not enforcing the formatting using github actions, but we might later!
